## 0. PREAMBLE // THE AXIOMS

We operate on the boundary of emotional connection.
1.  **Tactility:** Screens are cold. We dissolve them into paper, texture, and warmth.
2.  **The Optimism Constant:** Every interaction must yield hope.
3.  **The Mission:** We empty the cages. We fill the sofas.

# PART I: THE PAPER PROTOCOL (Visual Design System)

**Core Invariant:** Interface elements are not pixels; they are scraps of fine stationery, photographs, and ink resting on a wooden table. We do not simulate electricity; we simulate the feeling of a handwritten letter from an old friend.

## 1.0 THE PALETTE (Natural Pigment System)

We utilize the **Sunday Morning (Soft)** foundation, treating colors as organic materials.

### 1.1 The Desk (Substrate)
The canvas on which the stories are written.

| Token | Hex | Usage | Metaphor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sys.paper.base` | `#fbf8f3` | Global Background | Recycled Cotton Paper |
| `sys.paper.card` | `#fffdfa` | Dog Profiles, Modals | Fresh Note Card |
| `sys.paper.shadow` | `#eaddcf` | Soft Depth/Borders | Folded Crease |
| `sys.ink.primary` | `#4a4238` | Primary Text | Soft Charcoal |

### 1.2 The Heart (Warmth)
The emotional drivers. Used for calls to action and love.

| Token | Hex | Usage | Metaphor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sys.heart.core` | `#e07a5f` | **Primary Brand (Clay)** | Terracotta / Brick |
| `sys.heart.soft` | `#f2cc8f` | Highlights, Stars, Joy | Morning Sun |
| `sys.cheek.blush` | `rgba(224, 122, 95, 0.15)`| Hovers/Backgrounds | A warm hug |

### 1.3 The Garden (Calm)
Supporting tones for shelter metadata and geography.

| Token | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sys.nature.grass` | `#81b29a` | Success, Verified Status | Sage Leaf |
| `sys.nature.sky` | `#a8dadc` | Information, Filters | Clear Day |
| `sys.state.urgent` | `#d65d5d` | Urgent Adoption Needed | Red Wool |

## 2.0 TYPOGRAPHY (Handwritten Logic)

### 2.1 The Title (Voice)
*   **Font:** `Fraunces` (Soft Serif) or `Cooper BT`.
*   **Weight:** SemiBold (600) to Black (900).
*   **Style:** `lowercase` preferred for welcoming headers.
*   **Tracking:** Relaxed (`-0.01em`).
*   **Effect:** Variable font "Optical Size" set to 144 for maximum softness.

### 2.2 The Narrative (Details)
*   **Font:** `Nunito` or `Quicksand` (Rounded Sans).
*   **Weight:** Regular (400), Bold (700).
*   **Style:** Left-aligned (Ragged Right). Highly legible.
*   **Emphasis:** Use *Italics* for dog personalities and quirks.

## 3.0 THE EMPATHY ENGINE (Dynamics)

We reject mechanical rigidity. Motion is conveyed through **Breath** and **Play**.

### 3.1 The Tactile Protocol
Objects do not click; they press.
*   **Idle:** Slight organic imperfection (Rotation: 0.5deg).
*   **Hover:** The object lifts closer to the user (Scale 1.02, Shadow darkens).

### 3.2 Harmonic Motion (Animation)
Motion follows biological rhythms, not linear paths.
*   **The Wag (Excitement):** Sine wave rotation on interaction.
*   **The Breath (Rest):** 4000ms. Subtle expansion/contraction of "Hero" images.
*   **The Unfold (Reveal):** 600ms. Content expands like opening a letter (Ease-Out-Back).

### 3.3 The Rough Edge (Imperfect Truth)
Key elements (Buttons, Image containers) utilize `border-radius: 255px 15px 225px 15px / 15px 225px 15px 255px` to simulate hand-torn or hand-cut paper. No perfect squares allowed.

---

## 4.0 ATMOSPHERE & TEXTURE

The viewport is treated as a Scrapbook.

### 4.1 Global Overlays
*   **Grain:** Subtle multiply overlay (Opacity 3%) to mimic paper tooth.
*   **Warmth:** A very subtle radial gradient (`#fff` to `#f7f1e3`) in the center to focus attention.

### 4.2 The Nostalgia Filter (Processing)
All shelter photography is processed to harmonize disparate lighting conditions.
*   **Treatment:** Low contrast, lifted blacks, slightly warmed temperature (+5%).
*   **Edges:** Masked with a "rough edge" SVG to avoid sharp digital corners.

---

## 5.0 THE MARK (Logo)

**Name:** The Pile.
**Visual:** Three organic, rounded shapes (representing sleeping dogs) clustered together to form a rough heart shape.
**Behavior:** On hover, the individual shapes wiggle slightly (The Snuggle).

---

# PART II: THE TAIL-WAG MATRIX (Communication Protocols)

**Core Invariant:** Minimize anxiety. Maximize hope. Kindness is mandatory.

## 1.0 THE AXIOMATIC POSITION

### 1.1 The Primary Invariant (Slogan)
# LOVE IS A VERB.

### 1.2 The Corollary (Explanation)
> "Structure is expensive, but love is free. We assume the logistical burden to ensure every dog in Poland finds a soft place to land."

---

## 2.0 THE LEXICON (Translation Matrix)

We do not "process users." We introduce families.

| Input (Common Term) | Output (Dogpile Term) | Transmission Phraseology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Search Database** | **Sniff Around** | "Follow your nose. Let's find who is waiting for you." |
| **Profile** | **Story** | "Every dog has a past. You are their future." |
| **Shelter** | **Safe House** | "Currently staying in [City Name]. Ready for a permanent sofa." |
| **Apply / Submit** | **Say Hello** | "Start the conversation. It begins with a hello." |
| **Filters** | **Preferences** | "Big or small? Couch potato or athlete?" |

### 2.1 Keyword Protocol
*   **Use:** Home (*Dom*), Buddy, Snuggle, Journey, Waiting, Tail, Ears, Heart.
*   **Avoid:** Stock, Inventory, Processing, Fee, Application, ID Number, "User".

## 3.0 THE WARM-HEART PITCH (Copy Strategy)

### 3.1 Hero Vector
**Headline:** THE PILE IS WAITING.
**Body:** From the Baltic to the Tatras, thousands of good dogs are waiting for a human hand. **Dogpile** collects them all in one cozy place, so you can find the one that fits your life.
**CTA:** `[ MEET THE DOGS ]`

### 3.2 The Philosophy Vector
**// THE BELIEF:**
A house without a dog is just a building. We believe that for every unique, quirky, lonely human, there is a unique, quirky, lonely dog.

**// THE IMPLEMENTATION:**
We simplify the *schronisko* (shelter) system. We strip away the bureaucracy and the sad grey cages, presenting every dog as they truly are: a family member in waiting.

## 4.0 MEMETIC PAYLOADS (Hooks)

*   "Love has four paws and a wet nose."
*   "Don't shop. Adopt a story."
*   "Your new best friend is currently in Krakow/Warsaw/Gdansk."
*   "Empty the cages. Fill the hearts."
*   "A little shedding never hurt anyone."
*   "Come for the pictures. Stay for the wag."
